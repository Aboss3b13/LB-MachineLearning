### Dataset Description
This dataset provides detailed information about the prices of houses across various locations, including the state, city, and zip code of the property. Additionally, it includes key features of the properties, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the size of the lot, which is measured in acres. The dataset is structured to offer a comprehensive overview of factors that may influence property prices, allowing for analysis and prediction modeling.

### Privacy and Measures
The dataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII) beyond the general location and property details. While it originally included street names and broker IDs, I have taken measures to ensure privacy by removing these sensitive elements. Therefore, the dataset is fully anonymized and does not compromise any personal data or privacy.


### My goal
The objective of this project is to develop a model that can predict property prices based on various factors such as location (state, city, zip code) and property characteristics (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and lot size). By analyzing the relationships between these attributes and property values, I aim to build a machine learning model that can accurately estimate house prices.
